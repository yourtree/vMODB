/**
 * In a virtual microservice paradigm, internal components exchange a lot of internal events.
 * Some components require consuming from different streams (e.g. {@link VmsComplexTransactionScheduler}).
 * Other only publish (task) and others consume from one and publish to another.
 * There are some limitations with Java interfaces. One of them is that a class cannot
 * implement the same interface twice, even though different types are used.
 * Besides, the {@link java.util.concurrent.Flow} interface requires a concrete implementation
 * and tie together the consumer and producer with the "requires" method call to receive data.
 * I believe this request nature is not fruitful here.
 * To decouple the components, this interface is used to hide the queue concrete implementations
 * and each component makes use of the queue of interest of its own work.
 * In the end, these are just explicit channels for different threads to communicate with
 * each other. Basically a message-passing mechanism.
